To run:

Look at final_organizer.ipynb file

[base_move -> Look throuogh all files in sub-directories and pull data into Catrgory folders in root]

Plan - two ways

1. To get base folders - better way to adopt move by date function - YYYY/[category]
2. To catrgorise inside folders - Look through all files in sub-directories and pull data into Category folders in root - [sub-directory]/[category]

Move files by specific date - requiremtn - frst sort by years and then run

To RUn:

python "D:\Organizer\file_organizer.py" -r "<folder_path>" -d [True/False] -m [True/False]

where:
 1. -r -> root_path
 2. -d -> date_wise
 3. -m -> move to root
